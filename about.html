                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <p>
                        I’m a motivated and detail-oriented IT student in my second year at Ontario Tech University, pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Networking and Information Technology Security. I thrive in fast-paced environments and enjoy applying technical expertise to deliver practical, secure, and efficient solutions
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My passion lies in leveraging technology to improve everyday systems, whether it's optimizing network infrastructure, automating workflows, or enhancing user experiences. I’m especially drawn to cybersecurity, where I can combine analytical thinking with real-world impact
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I bring a strong foundation in Microsoft Office Suite, Python, and Linux, along with hands-on experience in customer service, inventory management, and team engagement through my work at Best Buy Canada. I’m also actively involved in student leadership and wellness initiatives, helping peers grow both professionally and personally
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whether I’m building a grading calculator in Python, designing secure networks in Cisco Packet Tracer, or organizing career events for Business and IT Society, I approach every challenge with curiosity, empathy, and a drive to make things better. I’m fluent in English, French, and Urdu, and always eager to collaborate, learn, and lead
